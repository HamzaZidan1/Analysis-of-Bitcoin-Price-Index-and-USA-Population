# Analysis of Bitcoin Price Index and USA Population

## Introduction
This notebook presents an analysis of the correlation between the current Bitcoin Price Index, scraped from CoinDesk, and the population of the United States. The primary objective is to understand the relationship between these two factors and to predict potential growth and use of Bitcoin in the United States.

## Contents
- ## Based on my analysis of the current Bitcoin Price Index and USA population data, it appears that there is a positive correlation between the population of the United States and the rate of Bitcoin. However, it is difficult to predict future growth of the currency and its use in the United States based solely on these two factors. Further analysis and examination of additional data points will be necessary to fully understand the potential use and growth of Bitcoin in the United States.

## Summary
Based on the analysis, there appears to be a positive correlation between the population of the United States and the rate of Bitcoin. However, predicting future growth of the currency and its use in the United States based solely on these two factors is challenging. A more comprehensive study involving additional data points would be necessary to fully understand the potential use and growth of Bitcoin in the United States.
